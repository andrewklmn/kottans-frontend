## [Git Basics](https://github.com/kottans/frontend/blob/master/tasks/git-intro.md)

### What was learned:
- [x] Free video course [Version Control with Git](https://www.udacity.com/course/version-control-with-git--ud123) on Udacity.
- [x] Practice cource [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/). It was just like a game!

I bookmarked this one [Git Cheat Sheets](https://training.github.com/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet/) because I hope it can help me in the future for sure. 

[What is Markdown?](https://github.com/andrewklmn/markdown-portfolio/issues/1) is great tutorial about how to use Markdown on Github.

### My impressions:
I have been using git and github for my home projects just as a remote backup system for long period. 
But now I figured out one thing. When you meet your new working team, you have to ask one 
important question: 

**What do you prefer, guys? Merge or rebase?**

### What was new: 

Possibility to print something right from console was really new for me. 

### What surprised me: 

The same as the new one... 

### What I'm going to use in future:

Hmmm... I use console commands every day on my Linux laptop for different administrative tasks, for git, for ssh remote control...
So I'm going to use all of these commands as long as I could... next 50 years at least, I hope... )))))

### Some summary about my HTTP knowledge:
Of course, I have used GET and POST requests in my project. But now I want to have a task in the future where I can use PUT, DELETE, HEAD, and OPTION...

## [Git Collaboration](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud456)

![Lesson results](/task_git_collaboration/git_collab_lessons.gif)

I have used one new piece of knowledge about collaboration work during those lessons. 
I have fetched from upstream repository new commits to my local repository and have rebased and pushed to my fork on Github. It brought my fork to the upstream actual state with console commands just in my local repo! This is amazing! )))

I was surprised that Github Pull Request workflow is so useful, simple, and comfortable for making changes in my pull request to kottans/mock-repo.

And this one from Codecademy Learn HTML Course:

These short courses are a great reminder about the roots of Front-end Web Development. It is impossible to do something in this sphere without these basic pieces of knowledge.

By the way, optional materials are a little more exciting: [https://www.freecodecamp.org/andrewklmn](https://www.freecodecamp.org/andrewklmn)

## [Responsive Web Design](https://github.com/kottans/frontend/blob/master/tasks/html-css-responsive.md)

- [x] [Responsive Web Design Fundamentals](https://www.udacity.com/course/responsive-web-design-fundamentals--ud893) on Udacity.
- [x] [Flexbox Froggy](http://flexboxfroggy.com/)
- [x] [Grid Garden](http://cssgridgarden.com/)

[![Grid Garden](task_responsive_web_design/grid_garden_css.gif)](http://cssgridgarden.com/)

### What was new: 

Udacity course has clarified for me the situation with responsive web design using CSS at last. No more Bootstrap magic!

### What surprised me: 

I have used Bootstrap in my projects for responsive pages, but now I can do this stuff even without Bootstrap!

### What I'm going to use in future:

Breakpoint selection, media queries, responsive tables, grid and flexbox - I have all of them in my toolbox now.

## HTML & CSS practice

This task was developed without JS. And was tested in FF and Google Chrome (Linux and Windows both).
