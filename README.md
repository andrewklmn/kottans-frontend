## [Git Basics](https://github.com/kottans/frontend/blob/master/tasks/git-intro.md)

### What was learned:
- [x] Free video course [Version Control with Git](https://www.udacity.com/course/version-control-with-git--ud123) on Udacity.
- [x] Practice cource [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/). It was just like a game!

I bookmarked this one [Git Cheat Sheets](https://training.github.com/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet/) because I hope it can help me in the future for sure. 

[What is Markdown?](https://github.com/andrewklmn/markdown-portfolio/issues/1) is great tutorial about how to use Markdown on Github.

### My impressions:
I have been using git and github for my home projects just as a remote backup system for long period. 
But now I figured out one thing. When you meet your new working team, you have to ask one 
important question: 

**What do you prefer, guys? Merge or rebase?**

## [Linux CLI, and HTTP](https://github.com/kottans/frontend/blob/master/tasks/linux-cli-http.md)

### What was new: 

Possibility to print something right from console was really new for me. 

### What surprised me: 

The same as the new one... 

### What I'm going to use in future:

Hmmm... I use console commands every day on my Linux laptop for different administrative tasks, for git, for ssh remote control...
So I'm going to use all of these commands as long as I could... next 50 years at least, I hope... )))))

### Some summary about my HTTP knowledge:
Of course, I used to use GET and POST requests in my project before. But now I want to have a task in the future where I can use PUT, DELETE, HEAD, and OPTION...
